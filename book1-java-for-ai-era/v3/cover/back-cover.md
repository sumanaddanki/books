# About This Book

**AI writes Java code in seconds. Can you tell if it's right?**

In the AI era, the developers who thrive aren't those who memorize syntax. They're the ones who understand code well enough to guide AI and catch its mistakes.

This book teaches you Java *understanding*, not Java *syntax*. You'll learn:

- Why AI generates code with floating-point money bugs
- When AI ignores your existing classes and duplicates code
- How to spot null pointer exceptions before they crash production
- Which collection AI should have used instead of ArrayList
- The prompts that get better code from AI
- The checklist that catches AI mistakes in 5 minutes

---

## What You'll Master

- **Java Types** - BigDecimal for money, long for large counts
- **OOP Principles** - Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- **Error Handling** - try-with-resources, exception chaining
- **Collections** - HashSet vs ArrayList, HashMap vs TreeMap
- **Modern Java** - Streams, lambdas, Optional
- **AI Integration** - Prompting effectively, reviewing systematically

## Who This Book Is For

- Developers using AI coding assistants (Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT)
- Anyone learning Java in 2025 and beyond
- Engineers who want to review AI output confidently
