# Acknowledgments

This book was written with AI assistance—specifically, Claude by Anthropic. The irony isn't lost on me: a book about reviewing AI output, written with AI.

But that's exactly the point.

AI helped structure chapters, generate examples, and maintain consistency. A human—me—decided what concepts mattered, which disasters to include, and whether the explanations actually explained anything.

The collaboration worked because I knew enough to guide AI and catch its mistakes. That's the skill this book teaches.

- The developers whose bugs became teaching moments (anonymized, of course)
- The AI tools that make coding faster and reviewing essential
- Everyone who believes that understanding beats memorization
