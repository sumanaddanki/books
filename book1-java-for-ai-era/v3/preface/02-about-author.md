# About the Author

## Suman Addanke

Suman Addanke is a software engineer who has spent years watching developers struggle—not with coding, but with understanding code.

The AI revolution didn't change this struggle. It amplified it. Developers now produce more code faster, but the bugs come just as fast. The missing piece isn't better AI. It's better understanding.

This book series—starting with Java and expanding to databases and frontend development—captures the essential knowledge developers need to work effectively with AI tools.

## Philosophy

**"AI is a multiplier. If you understand the fundamentals, AI multiplies your effectiveness. If you don't, it multiplies your mistakes."**

This book doesn't fight AI. It embraces AI while building the judgment needed to use it safely.

## Book Series

This is the first book in a planned series:

1. **Java for the AI Era** (This book)
2. **Database Engineering for the AI Era** (Planned)
3. **UI/Frontend for the AI Era** (Planned)

Each book applies the same philosophy—concepts over syntax, understanding over memorization—to its domain.
