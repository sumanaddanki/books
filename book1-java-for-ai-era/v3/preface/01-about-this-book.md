# About This Book

## Why This Book Exists

AI can write Java code faster than any human. But AI doesn't *understand* Java. It patterns-matches from millions of examples, producing code that often works—and sometimes doesn't.

The question isn't whether you'll use AI for coding. You already do, or you will. The question is: **Can you tell when AI gets it wrong?**

This book exists to give you that ability.

## What This Book Is

This is a book about Java *understanding*, not Java *syntax*. You won't memorize how to write a for-loop—AI handles that. Instead, you'll learn:

- **Why** certain patterns exist
- **When** they should be used
- **What** can go wrong
- **How** to catch AI mistakes

Each chapter starts with real disaster scenarios—bugs that actually happened when developers trusted AI without understanding. You'll see the code, understand what went wrong, and learn what knowledge would have prevented it.

## What This Book Is Not

This is not a comprehensive Java reference. It won't teach you every API or framework. It won't prepare you to write Java without AI assistance.

This book assumes you have AI. It teaches you how to use it safely.

## How to Use This Book

1. **Read the disasters first** - Each chapter opens with real scenarios. Let them sink in.

2. **Understand the concepts** - Not to memorize, but to recognize patterns.

3. **Take the quizzes** - Each chapter ends with 10 questions. They test understanding, not recall.

4. **Complete the final assessment** - 50 questions covering all chapters.

5. **Keep the checklists** - The review checklists in Chapter 10 are your ongoing tools.

## The Bottom Line

After reading this book, when AI generates Java code, you'll know:
- Whether to accept it
- What to question
- How to fix it

That's the skill that matters in the AI era.
