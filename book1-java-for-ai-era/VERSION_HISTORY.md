## Version 1 (Original - December 2024)
**Philosophy:** Traditional Java teaching with AI integration at the end.

**Structure:** 17 chapters + 4 appendices
- Part 1: Foundation (2 chapters)
- Part 2: Core Java Concepts (9 chapters with syntax details)
- Part 3: Modern Java Development (3 chapters)
- Part 4: AI Integration (3 chapters)

**Includes:**
- Detailed syntax for each Java concept
- Code examples for every topic
- YouTube companion video scripts
- Exercise structure

**Why we moved to v2:**
The original approach taught Java the traditional way, then added AI. But for GenZ developers who will ALWAYS have AI, memorizing syntax is less valuable than understanding concepts. V2 focuses on what AI can't provide: judgment, understanding, and the ability to evaluate AI output.
